```
- **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "isCorrect": false,
  "explanation": "Quadratic equations follow a specific pattern..."
}
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve Student Progress**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/students/{studentId}/progress`
- **Purpose:** Returns an overview of a student‚Äôs progress, including completed topics and improvement areas.
- **Why It Exists:** To give teachers and students insight into learning performance.
- **How to Use:** Replace `{studentId}` with a valid student ID and send a `GET` request.
- **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "studentId": 45,
  "topicsReviewed": 3,
  "totalQuestionsAttempted": 50,
  "improvementRate": "75%"
}
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Get Explanation for a Question**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/questions/{questionId}/explanation`
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the explanation for a given question to help the student understand the correct answer.
- **Why It Exists:** Provides additional learning support to reinforce understanding.
- **How to Use:** Replace `{questionId}` with a valid question ID and send a `GET` request.
- **Response Example:**
```json
{
  "questionId": 123,
  "explanation": "Quadratic equations require factoring or using the quadratic formula."
}
```

### Core Objectives:

---

- **Enhance Learning Outcomes**: Allow students to review their misconceptions and improve their understanding through structured revision.
- **Provide a Scalable and Maintainable Solution**: Built on a modern, high-performance tech stack to ensure longevity and future adaptability.
- **Facilitate Seamless Teacher-Student Interaction**: Enables teachers to assign extra work efficiently to students who need reinforcement.
- **Ensure a Reliable and Efficient System**: Implements best practices in software architecture, database management, and cloud deployment.

## üèõ Application Architecture
### **What Architecture Have We Used and Why?**
The **ImproveByFaz** project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern. This design choice was made to ensure:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is kept separate from data access and API layers.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to accommodate future enhancements like AI-driven learning.
- **Testability**: Enables unit testing at each layer without dependency conflicts.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer (e.g., switching databases) do not affect others.

### üìÇ Project Structure:

### **Other Architectures We Could Use Based on Infrastructure (Azure/AWS)**
Depending on where we host the application, different architectures could be utilized:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Microservices Architecture (Recommended for AWS/Azure Kubernetes Service)**
- **When to Use:** If the project is expected to scale into multiple independent services.
- **How It Works:** Each module (e.g., Authentication, Learning Progress, Analytics) could be a separate microservice.
- **Infrastructure:** AWS ECS/Fargate, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Docker Containers.
- **Benefits:** High scalability, independent deployments, fault isolation.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Serverless Architecture (Recommended for AWS Lambda/Azure Functions)**
- **When to Use:** If the system needs to run only on-demand without maintaining servers.
- **How It Works:** API endpoints can be deployed as **serverless functions**.
- **Infrastructure:** AWS Lambda with API Gateway, Azure Functions with Azure API Management.
- **Benefits:** Cost efficiency, automatic scaling, no infrastructure maintenance.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Monolithic Architecture (Current Approach - Best for On-Prem or Small Deployments)**
- **When to Use:** Best for small-to-medium-sized applications with limited need for independent scaling.
- **How It Works:** A single deployable unit with all features bundled together.
- **Infrastructure:** Deployed on Azure App Service, AWS EC2, or an on-premise server.
- **Benefits:** Simple deployment, lower overhead, easier initial development.
